# ScenarioWeek4

Our final project is included in the 'polygon-reader' folder

## Classes inclucded

**Drawing.java** : This class consists of methods that makes use of the Swing framework to draw out the Polygons. 

**Part1.java** : This consists of the main algorithm for producing the least number of guards for a given input file

**ViewPolygon.java** : This class consists of methods to help produce a polygon which represents the field of view for a given guard. The resulting polygons allow us to create the total field of view for a given map.

**fileReader.java** : These consists of methods to read through different types of input files and how to produce polygons/drawings for the relevant method. This could be to simple drawing of a map and given guards, or a map and producing the polygons from a given algorithm in realtime
